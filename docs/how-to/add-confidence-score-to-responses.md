description: Procedure to add an evidence-based confidence score to every response, including thresholds and disclosure rules.

## Goal
Ensure every response includes an **evidence-based analytic confidence score** that:
- supports quality gating and triage,
- makes uncertainty explicit,
- prevents overclaiming when evidence is weak or missing.

## Prerequisites
- You maintain a response template or a policy section that governs response formatting.

## Steps

1) **Reserve the last line for the score**
Add a dedicated last line:
`Confidence: <0–100>/100`

2) **Add a one-sentence meaning**
Add near the top of your policy or template:
“Confidence reflects correctness + evidential support; it is not a statistical probability.”

3) **Add a below-threshold disclosure rule**
If confidence is **< 90/100**, list:
- what is uncertain,
- why,
- what would raise confidence.

4) **Cap confidence by evidence strength when verification is required**
For claims requiring authoritative verification, cap confidence by:
source strength, directness, and convergence.

5) **Add a basis statement for high-impact/security claims**
For high-impact judgments, add a short basis statement:
key evidence used + key gaps + disagreement (if any).

## Copy/paste snippet
Confidence: <0–100>/100

## Result
Every response ends with an evidence-based confidence score and, when below threshold, includes explicit uncertainty disclosure.
