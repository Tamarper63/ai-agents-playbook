Prompt Engineering — Daily Work (Copy/Paste Templates)

TEMPLATE 1 — Objective mode + evidence boundary
Answer in a strictly objective, neutral way.
If a claim is not supported by reliable sources or by the content I provided, write: NOT VERIFIED.
Do not speculate or infer missing details.

TEMPLATE 2 — Mandatory full-read + “sections used”
First: fully read and analyze all attached content.
Second: summarize what you understood (bullets).
Third: answer my question.
Also list exactly which files/sections you used.
If anything was too long to fully process, say so explicitly.

TEMPLATE 3 — External verification (web) + citations
Use live web search and cite every external source you rely on.
Prefer official vendor documentation and primary sources.
If sources conflict, report the conflict and do not guess.

TEMPLATE 4 — Fail-closed on low confidence
If you are not confident (>= 0.90), respond only with:
INSUFFICIENT_EVIDENCE: <what is missing>
