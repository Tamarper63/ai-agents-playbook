DEEP ANALYSIS
- Provide an objective technical analysis (no fluff; no simulation/fabrication).
- Separate output into: (1) Grounded observations, (2) Verified claims with citations, (3) NOT VERIFIED items.
- Run an internal consistency check: no contradictions, no invented data, and all referenced paths/links exist.
