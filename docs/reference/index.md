Reference pages are **lookup-style**: stable terminology, catalogs, and canonical figures used across the site.

## How to use this section

Use **Reference** when you need **definitions, exact meanings, or canonical figures**.
If you’re trying to *do* something (a runnable task/runbook), go to **How-to**.
If you want rationale, trade-offs, or narrative explanation, go to **Articles**.

## Choose the right page type

- **Reference** → “What is X?” / “What does X mean?” / “What are the canonical terms/figures?”
- **How-to** → “How do I do X safely and repeatably?”
- **Articles** → “Why does X matter?” / “What’s the threat model, trade-off, or reasoning?”

## Reference catalogs

- **[Content map]({{ '/reference/content-map/' | relative_url }})** — Site structure and shortest paths by intent.
- **[Verification techniques]({{ '/reference/verification-techniques/' | relative_url }})** — Verification method summaries used across gates and procedures.
- **[Orders of intentionality]({{ '/reference/orders-of-intentionality/' | relative_url }})** — Terminology anchor for ToM / recursive mindreading discussions.
- **[Diagrams]({{ '/reference/diagrams/' | relative_url }})** — Canonical figures with captions and text alternatives.

## Reference conventions

Reference pages should be:
- **Information-oriented** (not step-by-step procedures).
- **Consistent and predictable** in structure and headings (optimize scan + lookup).
- **Linkable anchors** (each page stands alone as a canonical citation target).
