title: CODE-RPC protocol
permalink: /reference/code-rpc/
---

This repository treats **CODE-RPC** as a protocol for technical code review / refactor work with strict constraints (evidence-lock, no simulation, objective-only, verification passes).

## Where the protocol lives in this repo

- **Schema (placeholder in current snapshot):** `/reference/schemas/code-rpc.schema.json`
- **System prompt block (placeholder in current snapshot):** `/prompts/code-rpc.system.txt`
- **Policies (normative constraints):** `/policies/`

## Scope boundaries

- The protocol definition is provider-neutral.
- Provider-specific usage notes (e.g., OpenAI/ChatGPT) belong in: `openai-gpt.md`.
