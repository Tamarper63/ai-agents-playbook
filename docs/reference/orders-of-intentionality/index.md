## What this term means (as used in the literature)

**Orders of intentionality** are a way to describe the *recursive embedding* of mental states in a representation (e.g., “I think that you believe that…”), where the **order** is the number of distinct embedded mind-states in the chain. (Dennett, 1983, DOI: 10.1017/S0140525X00016393; Lewis et al., 2017, DOI: 10.1093/scan/nsx034)

This idea is often discussed under **mentalising / mindreading / theory of mind (ToM)** as *recursive understanding of mental states*. (Lewis et al., 2017, DOI: 10.1093/scan/nsx034)

## Related terms (established usage)

- **Mentalising / mindreading / Theory of Mind (ToM):** Ability to infer others’ mental states and recognize that mental states can affect behavior. (Premack & Woodruff, 1978, DOI: 10.1017/S0140525X00076512; Lewis et al., 2017, DOI: 10.1093/scan/nsx034)
- **Formal Theory of Mind (false-belief competence):** In at least one established framing, “formal” ToM is discussed as recognizing false belief and is *equated with second-order intentionality* (“I believe that you think … even when I know it isn’t true”). (Lewis et al., 2017, DOI: 10.1093/scan/nsx034)
- **Second-order false belief:** A classic developmental formulation of second-order belief understanding appears in the literature on second-order false-belief reasoning. (Perner & Wimmer, 1985, DOI: 10.1016/0022-0965(85)90051-7)

## Why this reference page exists (scope)

This page defines **orders of intentionality** as a *terminology anchor* for the repository, so that when other pages discuss “first/second/higher-order” mental-state reasoning, they can link here instead of redefining the concept. (Dennett, 1983, DOI: 10.1017/S0140525X00016393; Lewis et al., 2017, DOI: 10.1093/scan/nsx034)
