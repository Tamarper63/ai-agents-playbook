      ### Scope

      - Focus: security properties of LLM-powered agentic applications (orchestration/workflows, routing/selection, policy enforcement, session boundaries & context isolation, tool invocation, write-path enforcement).
      - Output style: engineering-oriented; emphasis on **testable claims**, explicit system boundaries, and mitigation guidance.
      - Public-safe disclosure: some writeups omit PoC strings and raw evidence artifacts; request private evidence under coordinated disclosure when required.

      ### Non-goals (out of scope for this section)

      - General application security guidance that is not specific to agentic applications and orchestration/control-flow.
      - Model-training security or claims about mechanism-level cognition.

      ### Focus

      - **Orchestration patterns (control-flow mechanisms)** — where control flow lives and how workflows are sequenced.
      - **State & lifecycle management** — what persists across steps and boundaries (session/thread/run), what resets, and when.
      - **Tool invocation lifecycle** — selection, authorization/enforcement, validation, error handling, retries, timeouts, and safe fallbacks.
      - **Retrieval (RAG) & context construction** — what gets retrieved, selected, and included in the model input, and why.
      - **Evaluation & test harnesses** — regression suites for multi-step workflows (robustness, failure-mode coverage, attack-oriented cases).

      ### Industry-standard baselines

      - **Orchestration (control-flow mechanisms)** / **Workflows**: control-flow mechanisms that dictate an agent’s behavior and the structured sequences of steps it follows.  
        Reference: OWASP *Securing Agentic Applications Guide 1.0*.
      - **Control plane / data plane (ZTA)**: in NIST SP 800-207, ZTA logical components communicate on a separate control plane, while application data is communicated on a data plane.  
        This section uses “control plane” as shorthand for the orchestration/policy communication and decision layer.
      - **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**: retrieval-backed generation where retrieved documents are used during generation.  
        Reference: Lewis et al., NeurIPS 2020.
      - **Test harness**: a test environment (e.g., stubs/drivers/test doubles) needed to execute tests.  
        Reference: ISTQB glossary.

      ### Section-defined labels (used for comparison)

      - **Orchestrator-led**: a controller sequences steps and enforces policy; the model is called for scoped sub-tasks.
      - **Model-led**: the model proposes next actions/tool calls within constraints enforced by the orchestrator.
