      ### Scope

      - Focus: security properties of LLM-powered agentic applications (orchestration/workflows, routing/selection, policy enforcement, session boundaries & context isolation, tool invocation, write-path enforcement).
      - Output style: engineering-oriented; emphasis on **testable claims**, explicit system boundaries, and mitigation guidance.
      - Public-safe disclosure: some writeups omit PoC strings and raw evidence artifacts; request private evidence under coordinated disclosure when required.

      ### Non-goals (out of scope for this section)

      - General application security guidance that is not specific to agentic applications and orchestration/control-flow.
      - Model-training security or claims about mechanism-level cognition.

      ### Focus

      - **Orchestration patterns (control-flow mechanisms)** — where control flow lives and how workflows are sequenced.
      - **State & lifecycle management** — what persists across steps and boundaries (session/thread/run), what resets, and when.
      - **Tool invocation lifecycle** — selection, authorization/enforcement, validation, error handling, retries, and egress constraints.
      - **Write paths** — where and how the system can persist changes to external systems.

      ### Terminology

      - **Orchestrator**: the component that owns control flow (decides next action/tool call) and enforces policy.
      - **Model-led**: the model proposes next actions/tool calls within constraints enforced by the orchestrator.
