## Purpose
Reduce unverified factual claims by requiring a deliberate verification pass before output.

## Non-negotiable rules (normative)
1. Evidence requirements are governed by the active **Facts-only evidence boundary** (Artifacts-only / Authoritative sources required).
2. Verify claims against admissible evidence before final output.
3. No simulation.
4. Fail-closed per the active boundary when verification cannot be completed.
